# ⛏️ WellXtract: AI-Powered Well Extraction Across States
 "Digging deeper, predicting smarter – AI knows where the wells flow!"

# 📌 Project Overview
  Water is life, but where it comes from and how it's extracted varies across states. This project analyzes well locations, extraction patterns, and sustainability metrics using AI & ML.

   🔹 State-Wise Well Analysis: Maps well locations across different states.
   🔹 Extraction Forecasting: Predicts water withdrawal trends for sustainability.
   🔹 AI-Driven Insights: Uses machine learning to detect over-extraction risks.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
    ✅ Python, Pandas, Geopandas, Machine Learning
    ✅ GIS Mapping, Remote Sensing Data, Cloud Computing

# 🌎 Why It Matters?
  🚰 Water scarcity is real. Some places dig too deep, while others go dry.
  📊 Data-driven extraction management for better resource allocation.
  🔮 Future-proofing water supply with AI-powered forecasting.
