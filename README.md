Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct projects that leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques:

Well Extraction Model: A model designed to extract and analyze well data from the District_Statewise_Well.csv dataset.

Railway Racks Forecasting and Scheduling: A project aimed at forecasting and scheduling railway racks using the train_revised.csv dataset.


- `District_Statewise_Well.csv`: Dataset containing well information across various districts and states.
- `train_revised.csv`: Dataset comprising railway rack scheduling and related information.
- `well_extraction_model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model for well data extraction.
- `xgboost_model.pkl`: Serialized XGBoost model used in the railway racks forecasting project.
- `main.py`: Python script implementing the well extraction model.
- `main2.py`: Python script for the railway racks forecasting and scheduling model.
- `test.py`: Script containing test cases for both models to ensure functionality and accuracy.
- `Forecasting_and_Scheduling_of_railway_racks.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation for the railway racks forecasting project.
